##  ❓ Challenges and Solutions 💪

   The most difficult task for me in this project was to bring all the components together and combine them into a single functioning mechanism. However, thanks to the systematic work and constant support of the mentors, it was still possible to implement this project.

   Despite the fact that this kind of project was the first in my practice, I must admit that the process of creating this project was very interesting and instructive, as it allowed me to consolidate the learned theory in practice. I am looking forward to the next projects to be able to improve my skills and deepen my knowledge.
